## Technology Stack

Frontend Framework: React: We utilize React, a popular JavaScript library, to build our frontend. React enables us to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

API Calls: Axios: We use Axios, an HTTP client, to handle API calls between the frontend and backend. Axios simplifies the process of sending and receiving data from the server.

Data Management: React Query: To efficiently manage data and ensure a responsive user experience, we employ React Query. This library simplifies data fetching, caching, and updating from APIs.

Form Handling: React Hook Form: For streamlined form handling, we rely on React Hook Form. It simplifies form validation, data collection, and submission, improving the user experience.

Secure Authentication: JWT Tokens: We implement secure login and registration processes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT tokens validate user identities and authorize access to protected resources.
